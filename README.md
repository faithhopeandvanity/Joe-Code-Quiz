# Joe-Code-Quiz
A multiple-choice quiz built with JavaScript, where you'll get to learn more about me!

When you click 'start', you'll be taken to the first question, which is randomised. A timer will start counting down from 90, and any wrong answer removes 10 seconds from your time remaining. The quiz will end either when your time runs out, or should you finish the quiz before then, when you have answered the final question.
