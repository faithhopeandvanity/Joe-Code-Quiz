# Joe-Code-Quiz
A multiple-choice quiz built with JavaScript, where you'll get to learn more about me!

When you click 'start', you'll be taken to the first question, which is randomised. A timer will start counting down from 90, and any wrong answer removes 10 seconds from your time remaining. The quiz will end either when your time runs out, or should you finish the quiz before then, when you have answered the final question, it will end then. 

Your score is the seconds remaining on the timer at the end of the quiz, should you manage to finish it successfully. The highscores page saves scores to local memory and asks you save your score with your name. 

The 'questions' array is contained in the logic.js file.
